## 💡 Key Features

### The CLI Does:
✅ Scans AWS Health events (last 90 days)  
✅ Filters SLA-eligible events  
✅ Shows beautiful terminal table  
✅ Explains what to do next  
✅ Links to awscostguardian.com  
✅ Runs in <2 seconds  
✅ Works with zero configuration  

### The CLI Does NOT:
❌ Calculate financial impact (that's the SaaS)  
❌ Generate PDFs (that's the SaaS)  
❌ Open AWS tickets (you decide)  
❌ Require sign-up  
❌ Cost anything  
❌ Collect data  
❌ Require setup

## 📊 Expected Results

### Conservative Estimates

| Metric | Week 1 | Month 1 | Quarter 1 |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| GitHub Stars | 50+ | 200+ | 1000+ |
| Website Visits | 100+ | 500+ | 5000+ |
| Signups | 5+ | 20+ | 100+ |
| Paying Customers | 0 | 5+ | 20+ |
| Recovered Credits | $0 | $50K | $200K+ |

## 💰 Business Model

```
Free CLI Tool
      ↓
User finds X events
      ↓
"See how much you can recover?" (CTA)
      ↓
Visit awscostguardian.com
      ↓
Free SLA credit audit
      ↓
Automated claiming (if they sign up)
      ↓
Pay 30% of recovered credits (success fee)
```

**Why this works:**
- Zero friction (free tool, no sign-up)
- Immediate value (shows events in 2 seconds)
- Clear pain point (losing money)
- Trust builder (open source, MIT license)
- Low risk (success fee, user friendly)

---

## 🎓 What Makes This Special

### 1. Genuine Value
The CLI is useful **standalone**. Not just a lead gen funnel.
- Users can use it without ever hearing about the SaaS
- Real developers find it valuable
- Community respects authentic tools

### 2. Transparent Model
We're honest about everything:
- "This is partly a lead gen tool"
- "Here's our SaaS for full automation"
- "30% success fee if you use it"
- No dark patterns or manipulation

### 3. Community-First
Built for sharing and discussion:
- Open source (MIT)
- Contribute-friendly
- Multiple platforms (HN, Reddit, Discord)
- Authentic engagement

### 4. Growth-Focused
Strategic execution:
- 7-day launch plan
- Multi-channel approach
- Organic + paid (R$100 budget)
- Metrics and tracking from day 1

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before You Launch:

1. **Update URLs and Names**
   - Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username
   - Replace `awscostguardian.com` with your actual domain
   - Update author name/email in setup.py
   - Update security contact in CHANGELOG.md

2. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python test_hunter.py
   python main.py  # (will fail without AWS credentials, that's normal)
   ```

3. **Read LAUNCH_PLAN.md**
   - Understand the timeline
   - Prepare posts ahead of time
   - Set up tracking/analytics
   - Budget for R$100 ads
